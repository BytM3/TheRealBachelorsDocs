# â… - Semester

## Overview
**The initial stage**, a crucial building block for the overall degree and the starting point for the necessary understanding of the following concepts.
Skills audit to more deeply connect with previous high school education. 

A very interesting semester that covered the fundamentals of algorithms, the well-known and basic programming language C, some excellent physics theories, computer principles, the command line, and of course some math.

Students typically find this semester to be **the most challenging**, but with enough discipline, they can get through it and largely contribute to the degree's overall success.

# ðŸ“– Spread And Radiation
Spread and radations allow us to transmit information across vast distances. Without these two phenomena, we would be limited to communicating only with those who are physically near us. 

We can now connect with anyone in the world instantaneously. This has revolutionized how we interact and do business, and has made our world a much smaller place.
