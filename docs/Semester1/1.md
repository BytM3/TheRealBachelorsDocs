# â… - Semester

## Overview
**The initial stage**, a crucial building block for the overall degree and the starting point for the necessary understanding of the following concepts.
Skills audit to more deeply connect with previous high school education. 

A very interesting semester that covered the fundamentals of algorithms, the well-known and basic programming language C, some excellent physics theories, computer principles, the command line, and of course some math.

Students typically find this semester to be **the most challenging**, but with enough discipline, they can get through it and largely contribute to the degree's overall success.

English is very important, the more you apply it to technology, the + benefits you'll reap.
