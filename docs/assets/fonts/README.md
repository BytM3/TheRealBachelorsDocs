#  The Real Font Deal

## What We Had Before

```js
darklightTheme: {
  siteFont: 'PT Sans',
  codeFontFamily: 'Roboto Mono, Monaco, courier, monospace',
  bodyFontSize: '17px',
  // other stuff
},
```

## What We've Got Now

```
ui-serif, Georgia, Cambria, "Times New Roman", Times, serif
```

## Why We Did This

1. **Familiarity**: This thing looks just like what Claude AI uses.

2. **Mind Games**: We're sneaking AI vibes into students' brains without them knowing.

3. **Looks Good Everywhere**: This font stack works on any damn device.

4. **Easy on the Eyes**: You can read this stuff all day without your eyes bleeding.

## The Big Picture

We're playing the long game here. When these kids eventually mess around with Claude AI or whatever, something in their brain's gonna click. They'll feel at home without knowing why.

It's like planting a time bomb of familiarity in their heads. When it goes off, they'll be ready to dive into AI thing like they've been doing it forever.

## How to Use This

We slapped it in our CSS and call it a day:

```css
body {
  font-family: ui-serif, Georgia, Cambria, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
```

That's it. No bullthing, just fonts that'll make your site look like it knows what's up with AI.
