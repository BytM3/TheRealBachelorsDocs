![THINKING ABOUT THE PERFECT DESIGN](images/welcome.png)

**Is it right for you?**
- **Future-proof career:** The demand for IT professionals like you is expected to continue growing.
- **Versatile skills:** Comprehensive skill set that allows you to adapt to changing tech.
- **Lucrative earning potential:** Companies are willing to invest more and more in top talent.

The power is now in your hands. 

üéØ Let's jump on this exciting journey together and discover the fascinating world of IT and tomorrows!

# Empowering Students
This guide aims to complement your degree by introducing you to a range of remarkable innovations that the world is constantly leveraging to provide value incl.  web, mobile development, computer architecture, security, and cloud computing.

**TL;DR** The content presented does not carry any official affiliation or rights from the designated institution. 
Instead, it represents a collaborative endeavor by 2 individuals committed to delivering information, resources and help you level up ‚Äî Why? Because why not!

# Path to options
In terms of your degree, you have 5 semesters total. After 2 semesters, the student should be able to select one of two specialties for the remaining three semesters. 

This will enable the pursuer to concentrate their studies on a specific area and gain more knowledge in that domain.
- IOT & Embedded systems (IOT)
- Network and Systems Engineering (IRS)

> ISTIC used to assign students with higher grades to IOT; This could imply that IOT is the best option. It is not. Both paths are excellent.

# Examining methodology
The asset below depicts the proctoring methodology used for each semester.
- **1:** A written exam on all of the subjects covered.
