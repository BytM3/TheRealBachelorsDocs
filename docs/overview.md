# Path to options
After two semesters of success in the chosen field of study, the student should be able to select one of two specialties for the remaining three semesters. This will enable the pursuer to concentrate their studies on a specific area and gain more knowledge in that domain. By choosing a specialty, students will also be better prepared for their future career.
- IOT & Embedded systems
- Network and Systems Engineering

> ISTIC used to assign students with higher grades to IOT; This could imply that IOT is the best option. It is not. Both paths are excellent.
