### Why are WE doing this?
We were and remain the type of students who learned most things online; it was always the preferred method of acquiring knowledge and passing exams. This is where the idea for this project arose. Everything is obviously available on the internet; it's just a matter of searching. Our goal is to gather as much useful information as possible so that you can complete your degree from the comfort of your own home.
