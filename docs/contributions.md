### Why are we doing this?
I believe knowledge should be accessible to everyone. 

Everyone deserves the opportunity to learn and grow, no matter their background or circumstances. Knowledge can open up so many doors for people, allowing them to explore new possibilities and develop skills that could help them in life.

It's always tough to find the right material when preparing for an exam. I know that struggle all too well!

Our goal is to gather as much useful information as possible so that you can complete your degree from the comfort of your own home.
