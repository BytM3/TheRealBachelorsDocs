## bro , i think we did ok

we knew the struggle firsthand

jawher and i started this project to change how people study for istic

we experienced the suffering of being in a public university 

finding useful material felt impossible 

you had to beg for your destiny

we took all our frustration and determination 

we turned it into a force for change

i with him decided to create magic

i didn’t know how this would end up

i never expected to create such a masterpiece

all i wanted was to put my experiences and knowledge out into the world

this idea wasn’t just about compiling resources tbh it was about transforming the entire system


we wanted to ensure that no student would have to go through what we did

no student ever have to endure what we went through

our guide was designed to be a game changer

..and it proved its worth

this fundamentally altered the culture of istic

students, saying it with extreme humility, began to embrace interaction and communication

the level of intellectual engagement soared

students were no longer isolated in their struggle

they are now part of this supportive community

our efforts paid off and yielded tremendous results

the guide not only made studying more efficient 

the guide also fostered a sense of camaraderie among students 

WE CAN SEE IT AND WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT .

the project became a beacon of hope 

the project became a symbol and testament of what could be achieved through collaboration and perseverance

now , <br>
students are more confident <br>
their academic performance is improving <br>
and they no longer feel like they have to beg for their future

we turned our suffering into a powerful movement, and it’s changing lives for the better

well done ,
