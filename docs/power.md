## i think we did OK

Jawher and I started this project to change how people study for ISTIC because we knew the struggle firsthand. 

We experienced the suffering of being in a public university where finding useful material felt impossible, and you had to beg for your destiny.

We took all our frustration and determination and turned it into a force for change.

I with him decided to create magic.

I didn’t know how this would end up. 

I never expected to create such a masterpiece. 

All I wanted was to put my experiences and knowledge out into the world.=

The idea wasn't just about compiling resources; it was about revolutionizing the whole system. 

We wanted to ensure that no student would have to go through what we did. Our guide was designed to be a game changer, and it proved its worth.

This changed the culture of how ISTIC functions. 

Students, saying it with extreme humility, began to embrace interaction and communication. 

The level of intellectual engagement soared. 

Students were no longer isolated in their struggle; they were part of a supportive community.

Our efforts paid off. 

The guide not only made studying more efficient but also fostered a sense of camaraderie among students. We can see it and we absolutely love it.


The project became a beacon of hope and a symbol of what could be achieved through collaboration and perseverance. 

Now, students are more confident, their academic performance is improving, and they no longer feel like they have to beg for their future. 


We turned our suffering into a movement, and it’s changing lives for the better.

Well done,
