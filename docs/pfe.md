## The Spectacle of Academic Culmination

I will be taking this chance to outline for you the entire process and the social interactions that must be fulfilled in order to get out with a great experience and a lasting memory. Wether you believe it or not, memories make the man and I want you to have more good of that.

From this point and beyond please...
- Satisfy the univeristy administration documents.
- Start or continue working on [your end of study project](learntex?id=action-required).

Considering the papers you have to validate with college.<br>
You should be more aware of these after [your summer intern](intern.md).

Let me kindly re-step the process in a better way.

Deposit an amount to the postal service and save the recepit.<br>
Take an agreement from your administration and others to company.

**What To Expect:**
- The head of deparment will assign you a mentor from university side.
