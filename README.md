# [Bachelors in Computer Engineering](https://istic.computer-engineering.tech/#/)
![Banner](docs/images/banner.png)

The project is entirely driven by students. Our primary goal is to provide the materials required for anyone to start their learning without confusion and lack of information. <br><br>
We'll do it with these quotes in mind.

> “Share your knowledge. It is a way to achieve immortality.”  –Dalai Lama

> “Every addition to true knowledge is an addition to human power.” –Horace Mann
